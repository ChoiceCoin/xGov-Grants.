## Abstract
Choice Coin DAN is a decentralized autonomous network, choice software platform, and R&D hub that uses the Choice Coin cryptocurrency to power its predictions and software systems. The goal for this project is to create a decentralized slot machine and betting platform using the Algorand blockchain. The project will have three parts.

1. First, the project will develop a smart contract for autonomous and on-chain slot betting distribution with Choice Coin.

2. Second, the project will create a new front end interface to allow easy Algorand wallet connectivity.

3. Third, the project will have a deployment and beta-testing phase with results reporting and user feedback for improvements.

*Preliminary Design*


## Team
Brian Haney

In 2020, I successfully completed a yearlong Fellowship at Stanford Law School focusing on software patents for machine learning and successfully publishing several scholarly research papers. 
In 2021, I was on the Algorand Autonomous team that won top prize at the 2021 MIT Bitcoin Hackathon.
I have written several research papers about Algorand, developed substantial software on Algorand, and have successfully managed and contributed to open-source software development on Algorand. 
I am also active in the Algorand community including the [Developer Forum](https://forum.algorand.org/u/bhaney44/summary).

## Experience with Algorand
I have full stack OSS experience building on Algorand.

## Roadmap
A detailed plan for the development and implementation of the proposal, including timelines and milestones.

### Milestone 1
#### Backend
Date: 01/08/23

Amount: 20,000.00 ALGO

Description: Autonomous and on-chain slot machine betting distribution.
This milestone will include producing OSS for an open source smart contract for a slot machine.
Users will be able to submit the Algorand Standard Asset, Choice, to the smart contract and recieve a reward if they win.
The results will be based on randomized functions.
The milestone will also include a final report detailing the software contributions.

### Milestone 2 
#### Frontend
Date: 01/09/23

Amount: 20,000.00 ALGO

Description: Front end interface to allow easy Algorand wallet connectivity.
This phase will include developing a front end react application to connect to the smart contract.
This will bring the application to users and let anyone with an Algorand wallet connect and play via the Internet.
The milestone will also include a final report detailing the software contributions.

### Milestone 3
#### Beta Testing
Date: 01/10/23
Amount: 20,000.00 ALGO

Description: Deployment and beta-testing phase with results reporting and user feedback.
This phase will include deployment of the full stack software for beta testing.
I will also solicit feedback from users to identify opportunities for improvement.
I will also host a bug bounty program to help improve the security of the application.
The milestone will also include a final report detailing the user feedback, bug bounty, and improvements to be made.

## Benefits for the community
A description of the potential benefits that the proposal could bring to the Algorand community and its users.

*Innovation:* A decentralized slot machine application would encourage innovation on the Algorand blockchain. Developers would be able to experiment with new slot machine games and features, which would help to make the blockchain more user-friendly and efficient.

*Transparent:* The code for the application would be open source, so anyone could see how it works. This would increase trust among users and make the application more secure.

*Secure:* The application would be built on the Algorand blockchain, which is a very secure blockchain. This would help to protect users' funds and ensure that the application is not hacked.

*Use case:* Decentralized slot machines would be a real use case for blockchain because they would solve a real problem. The problem of fairness in slot machines is a major one, and decentralized slot machines would offer a solution that is transparent, fair, and secure.

*Solving real problems:* It is important for projects to focus on use for blockchain and solving real problems because this is what will ultimately drive adoption. If blockchain projects are not solving real problems, then they will probably not be successful. Here, the problem we are solving is the slot machine problem, which refers to fundemental unfairness and local limitations of existing slot machines. For example, the odds of winning in slot machine games are traditionally overwhelmingly against players and this project will help to solve that problem with a new solution leveraging Algorand.

Decentralized slot machines would address both of these problems. They would be provably fair, so players could be sure that the results of the games are random. This would help to prevent cheating and ensure that players have a fair chance of winning. Additionally, decentralized slot machines would be more affordable for players. The fees for using decentralized slot machines would be lower than the fees for using traditional slot machines. This is because there would be no need for a centralized authority to take a cut of the winnings. 

As a result, decentralized slot machines would be a real use case for blockchain and would solve a real problem.  Overall, a decentralized slot machine application would be a valuable asset to the Algorand community. It would be transparent, fair, and secure, and it would encourage innovation on the blockchain.
